Alright so the title of my presentation here is predator-swarm interactions, and I'm just going to just right into it.

SLIDE 2

Right so the paper I'm going to be talking about is this paper from Chen and Kolokolnikov called "a minimal model of predator-swarm interactions".

SLIDE 3

So now I'm going to introduce the paper. Basically the idea is that in nature, you often have this situation where you have a bunch of prey animals, and they're being hunted by a predator. You can think of maybe a herd of zebras vs as lion or something. And often what happens is instead of the prey just like running away in random directions, they have this swarming behavior where they are trying to get away from the predator, but they also sort of stick together.

So basically what this paper does is it introduces a model of this predator-swarm situation, and it sort of tries to hit a balance between being complicated enough to model the situation accurately and being simple enough to do some analysis stuff, like find the study the steady states and study their stabilities.

So now I'm going to introduce the model from the paper. We're going to look at a more general version a little later on where we will trade away some of the simplicity in exchange for more accuracy, but for now we're just sticking to the simple version where it's easy to find the steady states. And this simple version is actually pretty good. It captures a lot of the things you see in the physical situation as we'll see later in the numerical simulation.

So we're imagining that our prey and our predator live in 2D on the complex plane. You could extend it to 3D if you wanted to think about a flock of birds or some fish or something that lives more in 3D, but we'll stick with 2D because it's easy to draw.

So we're saying that we have N many prey, and that x_j(t) is the position of the jth prey at time t, and z(t) is the position of the predator at time t. And we're going to imagine these animals as point masses that exert forces on one another. So for example the predator should push prey away, and the prey should attract the predator. And it's probably reasonable to say that if you're an animal running around, that you experience a kind of friction in the opposite direction to where you're running, and we're saying that the magnitude of that friction should be proportional to the speed.

So then we end up with this general model.
